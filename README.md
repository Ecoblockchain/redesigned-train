Twitter stream viewer for WebVR I guess using A-Frame and a NodeJS-Socket.io server

I guess that's cool

Also Github came up with a cool autogenerated name for it

## How to start

Fill environment variables `TWITTER_CONSUMER_KEY TWITTER_CONSUMER_SECRET TWITTER_ACCESS_TOKEN_KEY TWITTER_ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET` to be able to receive data

Install dependencies with `npm install`

Run `node index.js`

Go to port `4000` on a WebVR-enabled browser such as mobile Chrome/Firefox or one of those special desktop versions of the two.
